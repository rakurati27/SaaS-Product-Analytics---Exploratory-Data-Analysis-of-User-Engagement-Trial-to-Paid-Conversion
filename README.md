# SaaS Product Analytics: Exploratory Data Analysis of User Engagement & Trial-to-Paid Conversion”

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes SaaS user behavior to identify the key drivers of trial-to-paid conversion using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Engagement metrics such as session duration, pages visited, actions, device type, and referral source were evaluated to distinguish converting and non-converting users. The analysis delivers data-driven insights to improve onboarding, optimize acquisition channels, and increase monetization for subscription-based products.

## Business Problem
The SaaS platform facing low trial-to-paid conversion rates, increasing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), thus limiting revenue growth. This project analyzes user engagement metrics to identify behaviors that improve conversion, optimize acquisition channels, and drive higher monetization and retention.
